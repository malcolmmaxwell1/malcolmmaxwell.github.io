While Sit-down riders provide operator comfort, stand up trucks are better suited to applications where operators are getting on and off the trucks many times an hour.</p>

Our Rough Terrain Forklift Train the Trainer Course, as well as our other Train the Trainer courses, are a great option for organizations looking to have one or more employees that can teach and certify various safety topics relevant to your business.</p>
