<p>Ziglift Material Handling is committed to your material handling needs and is open to service our essential business customers. When it comes to washing a lifted truck (or anything listed for that matter) being able to spray soap on the surface as opposed to applying in by hand is really your best bet for washing quickly. Material handling is an essential business. As an operator of a counterbalance forklift, you could find yourself in many different types of workplaces; from constructions sites to ports, warehouses, storage yards and factories.</p>
<p>The low step-in height, easy trailer connection and simple battery change make these trucks very user-friendly. For example, a sit-down, counterbalanced high-lift rider truck is more likely than a motorized hand truck to be involved in a falling load accident because the sit-down rider truck can lift a load much higher than a hand truck. The Universal Stance Reach-Fork Truck allows the operator to look comfortably straight up while storing and retrieving loads.</p>
