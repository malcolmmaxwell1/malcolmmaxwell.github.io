That's why we have forklifts and forklift parts for available. HIGH-LIFT TRUCK: A self-loading truck equipped with an elevating mechanism designed to permit tiering. Our diesel-powered counterbalance forklift models are designed and built for dependable performance in any application and have the power to cope with the challenge of outdoor conditions and demanding duty cycles.</p>
