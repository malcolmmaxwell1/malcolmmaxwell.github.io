<h2>Reach Truck Troy</h2>
<p>Forklifts are powered industrial trucks used to lift and move materials in short distances. Operators get excellent visibility with panoramic views of rack, loads and aisle. Therefore, a truck's suspension has to be lifted and its components adjusted so everything fits and works well. This is an efficient way of picking less-than-pallet-load shipments and is popular for use in large distribution centers.</p>
<p>Depending on your needs, you may find that a pallet jack is the best fit for your warehouse or product. These trucks like most of our products come up with the option of customization. Wrap orders before loading on trucks. In North America, reach trucks are typically stand up trucks.
