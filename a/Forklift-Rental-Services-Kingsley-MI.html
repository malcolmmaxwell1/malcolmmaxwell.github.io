<p>Pallet trucks should be durable, not disposable. More custom shops are toying around with lengthened trucks on custom chassis or even military truck chassis to create one-of-a-kind builds that get rubber-necked more than a 10-car pileup. Therefore, a fork lift operator must be able to use the machine to fit large, heavy pallets into relatively small areas, such as large shelving fixtures.</p>

<p>However, uneven loads and those that exceed the machine's capacity can cause problems. This will give the lifted truck shopper an idea of how much off-roading the truck has endured.

<p>In addition, alternate rated capacities may be established at other load centers and other platform heights. It happens because the one side of the chain is fixed to the immovable frame of the forklift, and the only way by which masts can move upward is when gears rotate in clockwise direction and pull the forks overhead. Raising your truck can help making towing easier, as the increased ground clearance makes loading and unloading more accessible.</p>
<p>I found the right forklift on Damoli's website and just ordered it over the phone. So this is not the same type of lift as a body lift kit. Class I vehicles include three-wheel electric sit-down trucks; and high- and low-platform sit-down rider type trucks with cushion tires or pneumatic tires. 123Forklift makes it easy to compare forklift prices, service plans and warranties on all used forklifts.</p>
