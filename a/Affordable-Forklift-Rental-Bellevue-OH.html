The Pivot Steer Forklift Truck is commonly used in industry both inside of a warehouse and is ideal for very narrow aisle work as the mast can be rotated 90° to either side of the truck. It keeps some of the ride characteristics you love from the factory Jeep Wrangler spring while improving the off-road performance.

Electric counterbalanced truck shows that it has actually eclipsed the performance specifications of most internal combustion trucks.</p>
