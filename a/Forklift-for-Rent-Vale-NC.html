<p>These powered industrial trucks includes reach and deep (or double) reach lift trucks as well as order selector trucks (also known as order pickers or cherry pickers). They provide equipment for residential, commercial, industrial, and specialized services across all 50 states. Also called a pump truck, a pallet jack is smaller in size than the above mentioned forklifts.</p>
<p>Towing: It's easier to tow heavier loads with a lifted truck since your truck won't be as at high of risk of bottoming out. If you are driving a forklift for the first time, one crucial thing to remember is that forklifts are steered by the rear wheels, unlike most cars. From lifting items into the shipping trucks to stocking things away in storage, their maneuverability lends well to various working environments and conditions.</p>

Our Military rough terrain forklifts incorporate above average safety & performance requirements designed to meet even the most rigorous military specifications, while our non-military rough terrain forklifts benefit from the trickle-down in technology that makes them exceptionally well-equipped in their category.</p>

The Toyota Order Picker easily maneuvers narrow aisles in warehouses with minimized rack impact during case picking thanks to optional wire guidance and double rail guidance systems. Industrial and powered pallet jacks in general weigh more than standard light-duty models.</p>

<p>Every rental truck is prepped by a Raymond Certified Technician and quality inspected by our shop foreman to make sure that each piece of equipment is ready to work when it reaches your facility.

<p>With FLC's training, they'll learn how to properly and safely drive both regular and three-wheel counterbalance lifts, maneuver their way through tight spaces, properly handle and travel with heavy loads and avoid collisions, falling objects and other types of accidents.

If it is not meant for roller chain pulleys then forklifts would require much taller cylinders to lift up the load to an equivalent height.</p>
