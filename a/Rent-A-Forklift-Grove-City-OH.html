Compact and high powered reach trucks of 1.3ton up to 2.5ton capacity offer fast response, easy operation and smooth load handling for high-density warehouse handling efficiency. Although trucks are rated at 24 inches load center, the load center for Test #N3 should be either 24 or 16 inches - whichever would produce the less stable condition.</p>
