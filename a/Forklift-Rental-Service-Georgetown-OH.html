On new forklifts we offer up to 72 months of either a $1 buyout or a True FMV lease option.

Different types of tyres are available for forklifts. According to a TICO representative, the materials handling equipment market as a whole continued to expand globally due mainly to increases in unit sales in Europe and North America as well as a recovery in China, although unit sales in Japan were on par with the previous fiscal year.</p>
