<p>8 Finished forklifts are shipped to the customer or distributor by truck or by rail.

<h2>Maximum Lift Trucks Ontario</h2>
<p>Class 3: Electric Motor Hand or Hand-Rider Trucks. Using the add-a-leaf will increase the height, but sometimes makes the suspension ride rough because of the added spring rate.

But with that freedom comes some drawbacks that need to be addressed in order for a lifted truck to work reliably and effectively as a daily driver.</p>
