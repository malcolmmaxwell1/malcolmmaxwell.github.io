In some cases, you may be looking to expand your business or take on work that requires equipment you don't have, like a forklift.</p>

This is not always a terrible thing, but it often takes some getting used to, especially if you have driven the standard model and then change to a lifted truck.

That one's a big seller here in the South.</p>
