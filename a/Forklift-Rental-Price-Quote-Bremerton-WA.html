<p>Order pickers do exactly what their name implies - they pick” orders in a warehouse for stores, other distribution centers, retail centers, and more. Once you've decided on the forklift fuel type and lifting capacity, begin your search for unused and used forklifts in our current inventory. You can also hire our trucks for a longer fixed-term rental period, for up to 7 years.</p>
<p>The result is simple: once the already-huge truck is lifted to an even huger height, it goes from "somewhat unsafe" to "incredibly scary." Not for the people in the truck, mind you. Whether you're venturing off the beaten path or commuting to work, the higher seating position makes it easier to see further down the road and over other vehicles. If the loads are too much for the load capacity of the truck, this can cause the lift to tip over.</p>
