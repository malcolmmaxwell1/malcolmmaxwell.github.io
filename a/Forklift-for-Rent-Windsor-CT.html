We will quickly and efficiently help you find the perfect equipment for your rental needs. 2+ years of experience operating the Counterbalance forklift. A truck-mounted forklift. Growing industrialization is anticipated to drive the demand for pallet trucks, especially from non-traditional industries in growing economies in Asia Pacific. No one services your forklifts and equipment like Granite Industrial can.</p>
<p>Telehandlers are four-wheel drive trucks with long attachments with forks in the end for lifting pallets and other equipment. Our range of second hand order pickers make for faster, more accurate order picking. You'll also want to make sure your truck can handle the added weight of larger tires, especially if you aren't specifically doing anything to the suspension itself.</p>

I am not an expert on lift kits, but based on my personal observation, they offer sizes like "six inches," or "eight inches," or "tall enough to provide storm shelter for a herd of Black Rhinoceros." That one's a big seller here in the South.</p>

If low clearances are an issue, CASE offers freelift masts that allow you to raise the forks 5 ft off the ground prior to the mast protruding, keeping your overall travel height lower.</p>

<p>If your warehouse is stocked full of pallets, a warehouse forklift is an efficient way to carefully load and remove balanced inventory from industrial shelving. Visit your local big-box superstore like Costco's, Sam's Club, Lowe's or Home Depot, and it's hard not to notice all those forklifts. However, in both cases, these vehicles have to be operated by a person who can either sit or stand while operating the forklift.</p>
