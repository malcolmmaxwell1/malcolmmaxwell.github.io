<p>We are offering Premium quality Heavy & Medium Load capacity hydraulic Hand Pallet truck. It is the highest capacity stockpicker in the line, handling heavy palletized loads at heights up to 366 inches. You may also wish to consult with a custom truck body modifications expert for advice as to which types of vehicles will best meet your individual needs as well.

We offer certification on the Counterbalance Forklift from the following awarding bodies: RTITB, NPORS, CPCS, LANTRA.
