This is the most common type of forklift, used in warehouses and shipping centers all over the world. If you have never really thought much about lifted trucks before, then you might wonder why you would ever want a truck lifted up in the first place.</p>

Lifted trucks draw attention from everyone on the road and act as giant billboards at local shows, putting that paintjob high up in the sky for everyone to see. Electric forklifts are suited for indoor use and have several advantages.</p>
<p>This means the lift truck doesn't have to face the shelves—it can drive straight while still picking up loads to the side.

We will focus on how to maintain your forklift's stability and handling, as well as how to lift loads properly.</p>
