<p>Using the procedure outlined for the test, an empty truck with the forks elevated to any height up to the maximum height at which horizontal travel is permitted, and for the travel speed allowable at that height, should not overturn when the test platform, and for the travel speed allowable at that height, should not overturn when the test platform upon which the truck is standing is tilted to the slope specified by Graph D, Curve 1, for unrestricted turning and by Graph D, Curve 2, for straight forward and reverse travel, travel, no turning ± 10 degrees.</p>
<p>The load limit is shown on the data plate of the lift truck. Monster street truck drivers are at the distinct disadvantage in close quarters when maneuvering, such as in stop-and-go driving, city traffic, and even parking.
