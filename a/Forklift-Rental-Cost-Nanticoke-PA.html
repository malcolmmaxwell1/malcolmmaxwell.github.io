They are transported on the back of a flatbed trailer or other large truck and designed for loading and unloading building materials within a range of rough terrain environments, including construction, demolition, mining, and other industrial job sites.</p>
<p>For example, a forklift with a 10,000-pound (4,540 kg) lift capacity is limited to a maximum lift height of 20 feet (6 m) and a maximum forward reach of 8 feet (2 m) when lifting a full 10,000-pound load.
