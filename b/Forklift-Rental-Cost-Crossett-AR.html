<p>The following particularly applies to pallet trucks with a platform: Many ergonomic elements and functions make it easier to operate the truck. Electric models offer a substantially lower cost per hour-of-operation than any of the internal combustion lifts. If you are unsure of what you want in a car, you need to create a shortlist of the trucks that appeal to you.</p>
