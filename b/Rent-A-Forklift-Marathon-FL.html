<p>Gray Manufacturing has produced the highest quality jacks and lifting products for over 60 years. We provide UniCarriers Forklifts including stand up and sit down trucks from 3,000 to 15,500 lb. They have the ability to reach loads that sit up high and can extend to distances beyond their stabilising legs. Compared to a forklift, these machines have a smaller capacity. Drivers should know the capacity of the machine to prevent tipping due to overly heavy or improperly balanced loads.</p>
<p>Why not check out our selection of used forklifts or contact us for more information. Not work on a forklift platform unless the industrial lift truck is on a firm flat surface and the platform is equipped with guardrails or a travel restraint system or fall-arresting system. For electric lift trucks and batteries, you'll want to review the battery charger requirements.</p>

<h2>Reach Truck Marathon</h2>
<p>These developments constitute a dramatic departure from the norm, according to Brett Wood , chairman of the Industrial Truck Association (ITA) and president and CEO of Toyota Material Handling North America. A reach truck provides a range of features to help you to do the job. Indoor forklifts come with cushion tires to make it easier to maneuver on smooth warehouse floors.</p>
<p>Virtually any standard sized truck can be lifted to a certain extent or another. Some pallet jack models are able to lift loads all the way up to 15,000 pounds (6,803 kg). The forklift and load must be considered a unit with a continually varying center of gravity with every movement of the load. The pallet truck is simply for moving loads from one place to another at ground level, but it has limited reach, while the lift truck is more complex and is capable of transporting and lifting a palletised load onto a higher level or for stacking loads on top of each other.</p>
<p>Make that used custom lifted Ford F-150 or Toyota Tacoma yours with our help. Picking cases or single items from racks in a warehouse is the only job an order picker, a single-purpose lift truck, does.
