They feature specially-designed lifting carriages and come in two configurations: with mast and with reach.</p>

Furthermore, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reports that more than 540,000 forklift operators are employed across the country in all 50 states. Designed to work in narrow aisles, the electric reach stacker can tilt both forwards and backwards for safer load handling.</p>
