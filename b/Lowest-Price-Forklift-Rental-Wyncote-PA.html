Whether they be a factory-floor, rough terrain, or telehandler machine, forklifts often face far harder service than most farm machinery. Although a primitive pissing contest in the eyes of some, the lifted-truck community does get down and dirty in some sections; namely the mudder section.</p>
<p>Whether you're looking to buy a new forklift, rent compact construction equipment, or service an existing machine, everything we do is rooted in the highest quality. But a truck with 31" tires just will not go anywhere unless it is paved and suitable for cars. When driving around in a lifted Jeep Wrangler, you are in control of a highly capable truck.
