The order selector operators ride up and down with the load and must be secured to the truck using a belt and tether system.</p>

Unauthorized personnel shall not be permitted to ride on powered industrial trucks. RICO's Pegasus counterbalance forklift series redefines material handling with our four wheel sit-down truck.</p>
