<p>Gray Manufacturing has produced the highest quality jacks and lifting products for over 60 years. We provide UniCarriers Forklifts including stand up and sit down trucks from 3,000 to 15,500 lb. They have the ability to reach loads that sit up high and can extend to distances beyond their stabilising legs. Compared to a forklift, these machines have a smaller capacity. Drivers should know the capacity of the machine to prevent tipping due to overly heavy or improperly balanced loads.</p>
<p>This vehicle offered a solution for non-skidded material handling while providing increased lifting height for easy load stacking. Search used lifted trucks for sale at Northwest Motorsport. But for long-distance material transport, has an optimum length, which provides easy control and excellent fork-tip visibility as well as ensures the operator a secure distance from the truck.</p>

Fork Size = Dimensions of lift truck forks, expressed as: thickness x width x length.</p>
<p>8 Finished forklifts are shipped to the customer or distributor by truck or by rail. Customization and accessories for trucks go beyond what the manufacturer offers on brand new models, however, giving truck drivers even more freedom to make their pickups their own.
