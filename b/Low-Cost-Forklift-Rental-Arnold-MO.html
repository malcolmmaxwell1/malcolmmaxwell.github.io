<p>Specifically engineered for the unique challenges of a narrow-aisle warehouse environment, the Crown RR 5700 features the industry's first traction control system, enhanced execution of load-handling functions, and the fastest lift and travel speeds among other available reach trucks. The aim of this course is to provide delegates with the knowledge and practical skills needed to safely operate an Industrial Masted Lift Truck. Whether a forklift will safely carry a load or will tip forward can be determined by comparing the moment (a tendency to produce motion) of both the load and the forklift. Our rental fleet stands ready to supply you with immediate equipment when a need arises.</p>
<p>Parts & Service - Our forklift parts and service departments are ready at a moments notice and can repair any brand of equipment in your fleet. Every rental truck is prepped by a Raymond certified technician and quality inspected by our shop foreman to make sure that each piece of equipment is ready to work when it reaches your facility. When you need to move materials, shift supplies, or store objects on a job site, a rough terrain forklift can do the job.</p>

The industrial forklift —also called a large capacity forklift—combines the functionalities of a warehouse forklift with that of a telehandler.</p>
<p>Omnidirectional technology (such as Mecanum wheels ) can allow a forklift truck to move forward, diagonally and laterally, or in any direction on a surface. This series offers models for rough-terrain applications as well. Originally a lock company, Hyster-Yale is now almost exclusively a forklift manufacturer. And with how much you can save with a high-quality pre-owned vehicle and still get behind the wheel of a safe, reliable, and ready for adventure car, truck or SUV.</p>

With a VR educational tool, operators can become more comfortable with all aspects of lift truck operation—from learning the controls to knowing how to navigate emergency scenarios,” says Comfort.</p>
