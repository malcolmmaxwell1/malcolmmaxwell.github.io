<p>Ziglift Material Handling is committed to your material handling needs and is open to service our essential business customers. There are so many things to consider when adding or replacing your used forklift equipment. Today, rough-terrain lifts have become the preferred forklift in agriculture. One of the key features of this type of forklift is that they are counterbalanced — meaning that the battery also functions as a counterweight for stability. Optimize your storage capacity by operating in narrow aisles at high picking levels with Raymond Orderpicker trucks.</p>
<p>That's why our focus is making the forklift rental process quick and easy, without the usual red tape and fine print of the big rental companies.

Our stores in Sacramento, CA and throughout northern central California are fully equipped to meet your demands for rental forklifts.</p>
