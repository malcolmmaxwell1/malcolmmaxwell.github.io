<h2>Be Aware When Operating a Fork Lift Truck in Dora </h2>
<p>If you rent forklift then it will work as a power based truck to lift and move industrial and raw materials. Experience proves that operators who are properly trained, keep within the forklift's load capacity, and follow rules of safe operation to avoid tipovers and accidents. In order to prevent the lift from tipping, the combined center of gravity of the load and the lift must stay inside the stability triangle (at ground level) at all times.</p>
<p>This is an extremely rare type of mast configuration and reduces the lifting capacity of the truck considerably.
