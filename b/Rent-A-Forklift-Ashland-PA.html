No forklift operator can predict every possible event.</p>
<p>Rough terrain forklifts can have a vertical tower, which lifts loads straight up, or a telescoping boom, which lifts loads up and out from the base of the machine. Maini's floor transportation range enables effortless transfer of heavy loads in your shop floors and warehouses. Motorized pallet jacks or manual pallet jacks are found in nearly every warehouse and are essential in many manufacturing and distribution work environments.</p>

<p>In addition, alternate rated capacities may be established at other load centers and other platform heights. It happens because the one side of the chain is fixed to the immovable frame of the forklift, and the only way by which masts can move upward is when gears rotate in clockwise direction and pull the forks overhead. Raising your truck can help making towing easier, as the increased ground clearance makes loading and unloading more accessible.</p>
