<p>While they move heavy loads and increase efficiency, forklifts can also cause serious injuries when they are used unsafely. Those are the vehicles that you will need to test drive before making a decision. OSHA standard 29 CFR 1910.178 covering PITs requires employers to develop and implement a training program based on the general principles of safe truck operation.</p>

Each Kit includes a set of "Load Leveling" Air springs specifically created to maximize load carrying capacity, ride quality, stability and overall braking control. As order pickers are mostly operated at elevated heights, it is important that operators are properly trained on maneuvering and safety of these trucks.</p>
<p>First forklifts appeared already in the early 20th century, and were used in World War II. Today, forklift trucks facilitate work of thousands of people, especially in manufacturing and warehousing sectors. One of the main safety risks for order pickers is falling from height when exiting the cabin onto pallets, partially enclosed platforms or racking. Our hand pallet jack import data solutions meet your actual import requirements in quality, volume, seasonality, and geography.</p>
<p>In digging around facts about a forklift rental company, some things you might consider are the company's service level agreements, the age and condition of their forklifts available for rent, as well as the questions they ask to rental enquiries. Standard forklifts generally measure between 4 to 7 ft wide and 8 to 10 ft long. Knowing your required lift height is equally important and will affect your unit's load-carrying capacity.</p>

Trucks with suspension lifts tend to handle quite a bit different than factory models, not only due to the higher center of gravity but also because of the changes to the suspension.</p>
