Ltd, Linde Material Handling, PalleTrucks-Trolleys, Jost's Engineering Company Limited, Toyota Material Handling Europe AB, PTB Special Product, Jungheinrich AG, and Crown Equipment Corporation are some key manufacturers operating in the global pallet truck market. Forklift rentals are not inexpensive.</p>
<p>Whether you are trying to learn more about these wonderful machines or perhaps hoping to diversify your fleet, here are the seven different categories of forklifts and a breakdown of what they are used for. Whether the driver will be using the vehicle for rock climbing, regular road travel, racing, or for use in sandy or water-filled areas, will determine the type of tires that need to be put on the truck.</p>
<p>The following are examples of Class III powered industrial trucks.

These forklifts are also known as straight mast forklifts. Using the procedure outlined for this test an empty truck with the forks elevated to the maximum height should not overturn when the test platform upon which the truck is standing is tilted to a 14 percent or 18 percent slope depending on whether the truck has single, rear-wheel drive (or brake) or dual wheel drive (or brakes), respectively.</p>
<p>Trucks are pushing such boundaries with lift kits these days that it's almost getting ridiculous to see guys actually climb into them. The smaller design and increased maneuverability of narrow aisle forklifts allow them to reach tight areas and readily respond to unexpected hazards effectively. Meanwhile, Crown introduced a new 2-stage TL mast , commonly referred to as a Truckers Mast,” for its Crown FC 5200 Series counterbalance forklifts and the pneumatic and cushion tire models of the Crown C-5 Series industrial forklifts.</p>
<p>Counterbalance forklifts are probably the most common forklift trucks used in indoor warehouses and stores in the Vancouver area. While it's true that safety officials (OSHA) are more likely to inspect large commercial jobsites than residential or multifamily ones, they will visit any site where incidents have occurred or where complaints have been made. The Class I, Class II, and Class IV have a moderated growth rate over the forecast period as end-users are largely adopting Class III and Class V Forklift Trucks for the various applications.</p>
<p>However, uneven loads and those that exceed the machine's capacity can cause problems. This will give the lifted truck shopper an idea of how much off-roading the truck has endured. Mainly for external use, the Toyota range of diesel, liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) and gasoline (petrol) engine powered forklifts offers load capacities ranging from 1.0 to 16.0 tons.</p>

Order picker trucks are another type of Class II electric motor narrow aisle truck. Rough terrain forklifts come in 2WD and 4WD variants; however, 4WD variant is the all-rounder that can accomplish all kinds of difficult tasks on rough terrain.</p>
<p>Furthermore, these rough terrain forklifts double as workhorses in the bush here in Australia. The test load should be equivalent to an unrestrained, homogeneous cube, the dimensions of which are twice the rated load center dimension, and should equal in weight to the rated capacity of the truck. Similar to a reach truck, the electric variety is only for indoor use.</p>
