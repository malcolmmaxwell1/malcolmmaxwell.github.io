Damage to both the forklift and load can be increased when the reach is extended while the truck is moving. We are one leading and largest supplier of Hydraulic Pallet Truck in North India. The most important part of parking lot safety for any vehicle, lifted or not, is being aware of your surroundings.</p>

Our product range includes a wide range of manual hand pallet trucks, hydraulic hand pallet trucks, high lift pallet truck, rough terrain pallet truck, heavy duty pallet truck and rough terrain pallet trucks. In addition to their smaller design, a reach forklift's cargo is lifted back within the wheelbase, enabling a smaller profile even when fully loaded.</p>

Many of the hazards posed by forklifts can be mitigated with custom signage and clear visual communication.</p>
<p>Each type of powered industrial truck presents different operating hazards. According to the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health ( NIOSH ), the three most common types of forklift injuries happen when: 1) A forklift rolls or overturns. For those who do a lot of off-roading, a taller stance adds extra ground clearance, and allows for bigger wheels and tires.</p>
