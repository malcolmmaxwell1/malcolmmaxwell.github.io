<p>Some order pickers actually load their pallets into trucks. Drivers in lifted trucks need to be especially vigilant for anybody entering or exiting their blind spots.

<h3>Why Manual Pallet Jack Safety Is Important Bella Vista AR 72715</h3>
<p>When you have a pallet jack at your warehouse to help employees tackle tasks that are physically challenging, you avoid this dissatisfaction, which can affect productivity. Reach trucks are used in large warehouses that store pallets several rows high on shelving or have deep shelves that can hold multiple pallets. The increased ground clearance reduces the risk of you damaging the underbelly of your vehicle.</p>
<p>Decrease speed at all corners, sound horn and watch the swing of both the rear of the lift truck and the load. On the other hand, they can be less stable when turning with loads and have a limited capacity range. Reach trucks are categorized as Class 2 lift trucks in material handling. This class of forklift is one of the most common, and what ones tend to picture when thinking of a forklift's appearance.</p>
