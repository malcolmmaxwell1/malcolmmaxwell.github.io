<p>Space the fork evenly from the center stringer of the pallet to balance the load. You would have to determine whether or not you are operating on a ramp, how heavy the load is, the kind of condition the pallet truck is in, and the distance you have to cover. If you've bought it from a store, it was probably lifted from its place on the shelf by a worker many feet in the air with an order picker forklift.</p>

Counterbalance forklift is characterized by its stability with the low center of gravity in its structure.

A parking brake (or mechanism) which may be a part of, or include the service brake(s), shall be provided and be capable of holding the truck on the maximum grade which the truck can negotiate with rated capacity load, or on a 10% grade, whichever is the lesser. The innovative 3-phase motors in our electric forklifts combine powerful performance with minimal consumption of power.</p>
<p>Rough terrain forklifts are used at industrial sites where uneven surfaces can exist. While there is no single best pallet jack, high-quality pallet jacks are made by companies such as Linde or Jungheinrich. These reliable reach trucks offer the operator the high-quality, comfortable and spacious position that makes the work safe and enjoyable. And, the Raymond Model 8410 pallet truck with second-level pick steps offers three heavy-duty, non-slip steps—accessible from either side of the truck—that lead to a picking platform for easy access to second-level load beams.</p>
