<p>First forklifts appeared already in the early 20th century, and were used in World War II. Today, forklift trucks facilitate work of thousands of people, especially in manufacturing and warehousing sectors.

<h3>Forklift Operator Job Description Template Evanston IL 60201</h3>
<p>A standard warehouse forklift measures between four and seven feet wide and eight to ten feet long. We're the best place to compare second-hand forklifts from the likes of Mitsubishi, Linde, Kamatsu, Nissan and Caterpillar - names that are trusted by companies operating across the world. Both of these stackers have the ability to lift to heights commonly found on forklifts.</p>
<p>Imagine the devastation of crashing with a semi-truck - that's the kind of damage you can expect from a lifted vehicle. Teletrucks, a new type of forklift, have an extending mast that is connected to a boom instead of a straight mast, giving them a wider range of motion. All rough terrain forklifts have a backrest that keeps the load in place. Ask the seller whether the forklift for sale is in usable condition, that the forks, mast, back rest, seat, chain and tires are undamaged, and if it has been involved in any accidents.</p>
