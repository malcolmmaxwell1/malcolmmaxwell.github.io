A electric hand pallet truck is one of the most commonly used lift trucks in industrial companies.

<p>Virtually any standard sized truck can be lifted to a certain extent or another. Some pallet jack models are able to lift loads all the way up to 15,000 pounds (6,803 kg). The forklift and load must be considered a unit with a continually varying center of gravity with every movement of the load. The pallet truck is simply for moving loads from one place to another at ground level, but it has limited reach, while the lift truck is more complex and is capable of transporting and lifting a palletised load onto a higher level or for stacking loads on top of each other.</p>

Hyster® Reach Trucks are versatile and highly maneuverable. As rental rates can be assessed differently, spelling out the time period can save you money by getting reduced long-term rates or reducing the term of your rental to the tightest possible time period.</p>
<p>A lifted truck also has a higher resale value because of how valuable these trucks are. We have used lifted trucks in stock from time-to-time, but we cannot guarantee availability on pre-owned models due to frequent changes in our inventory. As a result, customers should contact our team with questions about these suspension lift kits. The taller tires get the differential higher off the ground, reducing the risk of damage from obstacles, and all four wheels gain maximum traction due to the lifted suspension.</p>
