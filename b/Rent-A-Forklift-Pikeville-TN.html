<p>A forklift is also known as a lift truck essentially because it's a truck that can lift loads using a set of forks. Telehandlers look and function like forklifts, but have a telescopic boom that can extend forwards and upwards for different attachments, such as a bucket, pallet forks, or muck grab. If the forklift truck in front is driving too slow. Handling processes will be slowed down, the equipment will experience increased wear and tear, and it may even suffer serious damage under excessive loads.</p>

<p>Double-deep trucks are similar, but with longer forks, making them perfect for areas where multiple pallet loads are stored in each bay as they will reach right to the back of the bay. We are known as a 'One Stop Shop' for material handling equipment. The mast shall be at full rearward tilt and the forks the elevated until the point of intersection of the two load-carrying surfaces of the forks is 12 inches from the floor.</p>

Unlike most car repairs or upgrades, lifting a truck requires a little more effort than getting a few gearhead friends together on a Sunday afternoon to gather around a toolbox and a twelve-pack.</p>

We have both weekly and monthly forklift rentals available that are structured around our clients' specific needs.

<p>7. Teletrucks - Short for telescopic hander forklift, these devices are another option for users that are tasked with high lifting or facilitation of mezzanine storage.

<p>If you are new to buying a forklift, carefully consider what type of forklift you need. Our expertise lies in a consultative approach to providing the best value-for-money forklift solution available to suit your needs. Double-deep trucks have longer forks than stand-up trucks, and they are ideal for warehouses where a lot of pallet loads are stored in each bay.</p>
<p>Both Gasoline engine type and LP gas engine type have stronger power, hence suitable for heavy goods cargo work, while Electric and fuel cell types have zero emission and great quietness, which are more suitable for in-warehouse work.
