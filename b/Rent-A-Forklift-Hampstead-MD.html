Drivers should know the capacity of the machine to prevent tipping due to overly heavy or improperly balanced loads.</p>

A 2000kg load can be sufficiently moved with some effort; however, with poor ground, a poor quality pallet jack, unstable loads, slopes, etc., it will be much more difficult for the pallet jack worker.</p>
