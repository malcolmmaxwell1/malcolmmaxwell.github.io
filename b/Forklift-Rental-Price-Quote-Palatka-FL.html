<p>A lifted truck, often referred to as a 4x4 truck, is a modified vehicle specially designed for off road driving and other types of high-impact work. At a minimum, you should have a card or certificate of proof of training and the vehicle load charts (and attachment load charts as well, if applicable) on the jobsite—OSHA will look for these items first. In an effort to stand out but also fluently head off road and through disastrous weather conditions, we at Lewisville Autoplex Preowned suggest you try a custom lifted truck or Jeep vehicle.</p>
